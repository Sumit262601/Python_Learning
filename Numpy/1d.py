One-Dimensional Arrays in NumPy
A one-dimensional array (1D array) in NumPy is the simplest form of an array that represents a sequence of elements arranged in a single line. It's similar to a Python list but offers more efficient operations and functionality.

Key points about 1D arrays:

Creation:

Using np.array() with a list
Using np.arange() for sequential numbers
Using np.linspace() for evenly spaced numbers
Operations:

Element-wise arithmetic operations
Mathematical functions
Broadcasting with scalars
Indexing:

Zero-based indexing
Negative indexing (from end)
Slicing with start:stop:step
Attributes:

shape: Returns dimensions
size: Number of elements
dtype: Data type of elements
Common Functions:

Statistical operations (mean, sum, std)
Mathematical operations (min, max, sqrt)
Sorting and searching
1D arrays are fundamental building blocks for more complex array operations in NumPy and are widely used in data analysis and scientific computing.
